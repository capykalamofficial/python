# Python Course Repository

Welcome to the **Python Course Repository**! This repository is designed to help you learn Python through a combination of summarized lectures, practice problems, and hands-on coding exercises.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following structure:

### 1. **Modules**
Each module focuses on a specific Python topic. Inside each module folder:
- **Lecture Summaries**: Detailed explanations and examples in Jupyter Notebook format as per the video lecture(`.ipynb`).
  - Example: `1_variables_and_operators.ipynb`, `2_conditionals_and_loops.ipynb`, etc.
- **Practice Problems**: Notebooks for practicing concepts introduced in the lectures.
  - Named as: `problems_topic_name.ipynb`.

Additional folders contain problems categorized by type or difficulty level:
- **Problem File**: A Python script where you can write and test your solution.
  - Example: `problem1.py`.
- **Test Cases**: A script containing test cases to validate your solution for various inputs.
  - Example: `test_problem1.py`.

## Workflow

Follow these steps to get the most out of the course:

1. **Learn the Topic**:
   - Navigate to the relevant module folder.
   - Open the lecture notebooks (e.g., `1_variables_and_operators.ipynb`) to study the topic.

2. **Practice Problems**:
   - Solve the practice problems provided in the notebook files (`problems_*.ipynb`).

3. **Work on Problems**:
   - Open the problem file (e.g., `problem1.py`) in the corresponding problem folder.
   - Write and test your code for the given problem.

4. **Run Test Cases**:
   - After writing your solution, run the test case file (e.g., `test_problem1.py`).
   - Verify that your code passes all test cases.
